# Circuit Simulator - Selection-Based Component Addition

## How It Works Now

The circuit simulator now uses a **selection-based system** for adding components. This gives you precise control over where new components are placed in the circuit.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Selecting Components

**Single Selection:**
- Click any component (resistor or lightbulb) to select it
- The component will be highlighted with a blue glow
- A selection panel appears showing how many components are selected

**Multi-Selection:**
- Hold **Ctrl** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd** (Mac) while clicking to select multiple components
- Or hold **Shift** while clicking
- All selected components will glow blue

**Deselecting:**
- Click on the background (gray area) to clear all selections
- Or click the "Clear Selection" button in the selection panel
- Or click a selected component again to deselect just that one

### 2. Adding Components in Series

1. **Select** the component you want to add after
2. Choose **"Series (in line)"** placement mode
3. Click any "Add Component" button
4. The new component will be inserted **immediately after** the selected component

**Example:**
```
Before: Battery â†’ R1 â†’ back to battery
Select: R1
Add in Series: R2
After: Battery â†’ R1 â†’ R2 â†’ back to battery
```

### 3. Adding Components in Parallel

1. **Select** the component you want to add parallel to
2. Choose **"Parallel (branched)"** placement mode
3. Click any "Add Component" button
4. The new component will be added **in parallel** with the selected component

**Example:**
```
Before: Battery â†’ R1 â†’ back to battery
Select: R1
Add in Parallel: R2
After: Battery â†’ [R1 and R2 in parallel] â†’ back to battery
```

### 4. Default Behavior (No Selection)

If you don't select anything:
- New components are added to the **original resistor** (the default 10Î© resistor from startup)
- Series: Adds after the original resistor
- Parallel: Adds in parallel with the original resistor

This ensures you can always add components even if you forget to select!

## Visual Feedback

### Selection Indicators

1. **Blue Glow**: Selected components have a bright blue glow effect
2. **Blue Border**: Component outlines turn blue when selected
3. **Selection Panel**: Shows "ðŸ“Œ Selected: X components" when components are selected
4. **Instructions Update**: The tip text changes to guide you based on your selection

### Component Details

- **Single Click**: Select/deselect component
- **Double Click**: Show detailed component information panel
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Click**: Add to selection (multi-select)

## Advanced Examples

### Building Complex Circuits

**Example 1: Series Chain**
```
1. Start with default: Battery â†’ R1
2. Select R1, add R2 in series â†’ Battery â†’ R1 â†’ R2
3. Select R2, add R3 in series â†’ Battery â†’ R1 â†’ R2 â†’ R3
```

**Example 2: Parallel Groups**
```
1. Start with default: Battery â†’ R1
2. Select R1, add R2 in parallel â†’ Battery â†’ [R1 || R2]
3. Keep R1 selected, add R3 in parallel â†’ Battery â†’ [R1 || R2 || R3]
```

**Example 3: Mixed Configuration**
```
1. Start: Battery â†’ R1
2. Select R1, add R2 in series â†’ Battery â†’ R1 â†’ R2
3. Select R2, add R3 in parallel â†’ Battery â†’ R1 â†’ [R2 || R3]
4. Select R1, add R4 in parallel â†’ Battery â†’ [R1 || R4] â†’ [R2 || R3]
```

## Tips for Teachers

1. **Start Simple**: Have students practice with single selections first
2. **Visual Learning**: The blue glow makes it clear which component will be affected
3. **Experiment**: Students can try different configurations without breaking anything
4. **Compare**: Select different components and compare their electrical properties

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I clicked a component but it's not selecting**
- Make sure you're clicking directly on the component (resistor box or lightbulb circle)
- Try clicking the center of the component

**Q: My new component went to the wrong place**
- Check which component is selected (blue glow)
- Verify you have the correct placement mode (Series vs Parallel)
- If unsure, click background to deselect, then try again

**Q: How do I add a third parallel resistor?**
- Select any one of the existing parallel resistors
- Choose "Parallel" mode
- Add your new component - it will join the parallel group

**Q: Can I select components from different parts of the circuit?**
- Yes! You can multi-select components anywhere in the circuit
- However, new components are added based on the *first* selected component's position

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd + Click**: Multi-select components
- **Shift + Click**: Multi-select components
- **Click Background**: Deselect all
- **Double Click Component**: Show details panel
