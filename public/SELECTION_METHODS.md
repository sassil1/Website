# Component Selection Methods

The circuit simulator now supports multiple ways to select components for precise circuit building.

## Selection Methods

### 1. Click-and-Drag Box Selection (NEW!)

**How to use:**
- Click on the **background** (gray area around the circuit)
- Hold and drag to create a selection box
- All components within the box will be selected when you release

**Visual feedback:**
- A blue dashed rectangle appears as you drag
- Components that will be selected are highlighted

**Multi-select:**
- Hold **Ctrl** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd** (Mac) while dragging to add to existing selection
- Otherwise, previous selection is cleared

**Perfect for:**
- Selecting multiple components at once
- Selecting an entire parallel group
- Quick selection of nearby components

### 2. Click Individual Components

**How to use:**
- Click directly on any resistor or lightbulb
- The component becomes selected

**Multi-select:**
- Hold **Ctrl/Cmd** while clicking to select multiple components
- Hold **Shift** while clicking for multi-select
- Click a selected component again to deselect it

**Perfect for:**
- Selecting a single specific component
- Building up a custom selection

### 3. Visual Selection Indicators

**Selected components are shown with:**
- âœ… **Bold outline** - Thicker, darker borders (stroke-width: 5)
- âœ… **Bold text** - All labels appear in bold font
- âœ… **Blue tint** - Slight blue background fill
- âœ… **Blue glow** - Drop shadow effect around component

**Unselected components:**
- Normal outline (stroke-width: 2)
- Regular font weight
- No background tint
- No glow effect

## Deselecting Components

### Clear All Selection
- Click on the **background** (gray circuit area)
- Click the **"Clear Selection"** button in the selection panel
- Press **Escape** key (if implemented)

### Deselect Single Component
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Click** on a selected component to toggle it off

## Selection Info Panel

When components are selected, a panel appears showing:
```
ðŸ“Œ Selected: 2 components [Clear Selection]
```

This panel:
- Shows the count of selected components
- Provides a quick "Clear Selection" button
- Only appears when at least one component is selected

## Adding Components to Selection

### Series Addition
1. **Select** the component(s) you want to add after
2. Choose **"Series (in line)"** mode
3. Click an "Add Component" button
4. New component appears **after** the first selected component

### Parallel Addition
1. **Select** the component(s) you want to parallel with
2. Choose **"Parallel (branched)"** mode
3. Click an "Add Component" button
4. New component appears **in parallel** with the first selected component

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Students
1. **Start Simple:** Try clicking individual components first
2. **Use Box Selection:** For selecting groups of parallel resistors
3. **Watch the Bold:** Selected components are clearly bold
4. **Experiment:** Selection is non-destructive - select and deselect freely

### For Teachers
1. **Demonstrate Both Methods:** Show click vs. drag selection
2. **Highlight Visual Cues:** Point out the bold styling
3. **Practice Exercises:** 
   - "Select all parallel resistors using box selection"
   - "Select every other resistor using click selection"
   - "Build a circuit by selecting specific components"

## Keyboard and Mouse Combinations

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| **Select single** | Click component |
| **Box select** | Click-drag on background |
| **Multi-select** | Ctrl/Cmd + Click |
| **Add to selection** | Ctrl/Cmd + Click-drag |
| **Deselect all** | Click background |
| **Toggle selection** | Ctrl/Cmd + Click selected component |

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Build Parallel Group
```
1. Add first resistor (R1)
2. Click R1 to select it
3. Choose "Parallel" mode
4. Add R2 â†’ appears parallel to R1
5. Box-select R1 and R2
6. Add R3 â†’ appears parallel to both
```

### Workflow 2: Build Series Chain
```
1. Add first resistor (R1)
2. Click R1 to select it
3. Choose "Series" mode
4. Add R2 â†’ appears after R1
5. Click R2 (now selected)
6. Add R3 â†’ appears after R2
```

### Workflow 3: Complex Circuit
```
1. Click-drag to select multiple components
2. Choose series/parallel mode
3. Add new component to the group
4. Click background to deselect
5. Repeat for next section
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Box selection isn't working**
- Make sure you're clicking on the **background**, not on a component
- Try clicking in the gray area of the SVG canvas
- Don't start the drag on a component

**Q: Components aren't appearing bold**
- Check that the component is actually selected (should have blue glow too)
- Refresh the page if styling isn't updating
- Make sure circuit.css is loaded properly

**Q: How do I select components that are overlapping?**
- Use Ctrl/Cmd + Click to add them one at a time
- Or use a large box selection that encompasses both
- Zoom in if components are too close

**Q: Selection box is too sensitive**
- Box selection only triggers when clicking the background
- If it's triggering accidentally, make sure you're clicking components directly
- Small drags (< 5px) might be ignored as clicks
